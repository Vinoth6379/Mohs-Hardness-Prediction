# Mohs-Hardness-Prediction
   The Mohs scale of mineral hardnessis a qualitative ordinal scale, from 1 to 10, characterizing scratch resistance of minerals through the ability of harder material to scratch softer material.The scale was introduced in 1812 by the German geologist and mineralogist Friedrich Mohs, in his book "Versuch einer Elementar-Methode zur naturhistorischen Bestimmung und Erkennung der Fossilien", it is one of several definitions of hardness in materials science, some of which are more quantitative.The method of comparing hardness by observing which minerals can scratch others is of great antiquity, having been mentioned by Theophrastus in his treatise On Stones, c. 300 BC, followed by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia, c. AD 77. The Mohs scale is useful for identification of minerals in the field, but is not an accurate predictor of how well materials endure in an industrial setting.

# About Dataset
  Researchers and practitioners in fields such as mineralogy, geology, materials science, and machine learning may find this dataset valuable for their studies and projects. However, it's essential to perform proper data preprocessing, validation, and analysis before drawing conclusions or making predictions based on the dataset.

# Approach:
 • Data Exploration and Understanding:
     » Before diving into modeling, it's essential to explore the dataset to understand its structure, the types of features available, and the distribution of Mohs hardness values. This exploration might involve basic statistical analysis, visualizations, and domain knowledge research.

 • Data Preprocessing:
     » The dataset might contain missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies that need to be addressed. Preprocessing steps may include handling missing data, removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Additionally, feature engineering techniques might be applied to extract meaningful information from raw features.

 • Model Selection:
    » Various machine learning algorithms can be employed for Mohs hardness prediction, including regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree-based methods like random forests, support vector machines, and more advanced techniques like neural networks. The choice of model depends on factors such as the dataset size, feature complexity, and computational resources available.

• Model Training:
    » After selecting a random forests algorithm, the dataset is split into training and testing sets. The model is then trained on the training data, where it learns the underlying patterns between the features and Mohs hardness values.

 • Model Evaluation:
    » Once trained, the model's performance is evaluated using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for regression tasks include mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model generalizes to unseen data
